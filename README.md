I am trying to learn how to mod for my favorite game, Oxygen Not Included. 
Beyond being fun, it has shaped my interests and guided me toward pursuing a PhD in Metabolic Engineering, which I am currently applying for. Being able to utilize the novel critters and plants for both industrial and non-industrial processes, culminating into space travel and exploration, has been what captivated me.
Slowly but surely making progress, one step at a time.

I have big aspirations for this mod, just need to learn the different parts. My plan is to essentially make an overhaul mod.
So far: (as of 9/15/2025 || Month/Day/Year)
  - I have learned to properly add new elements (gas, solid, liquid) into the game, using either custom tile textures and noise, or by copying another element's.
  - Nearly done learning how to properly add new worldgen features, such as custom clusters, biomes, subworlds, worlds, etc. Just need to figure out how to fix the error when creating custom temperature ranges in the temperatures.yaml file.
  - Next is to add new recipes to existing buildings (already messed with, need to get better), and create new buildings (including but not limited to, power generation, manufacturing, batteries)
  - Trying to learn nearly everything.

If you like the idea of an overhaul mod, feel free to contact me on discord (Q || q_the_gaming || Q.#4128) - I am also in the Oxygen Not Included discord server.

I am very open to any ideas, assistance with debugging/errors, contribution to the mod via any type of content, etc. 
Anything to help me to learn more quickly and start publishing the beginnings of this mod.
If you love drawing/making art, I would graciously accept any assistence/contributions with the art and/or animations!
  - I am trying to get better at making art on a computer/tablet, as I have only drawn on paper.
  - I am trying to get better at annimations as well, using Spriter. I am slowly getting the hange of it, but will be experimenting more when I start making custom buildings.

Of course, anyone who helps in any way will be listed as contributors, special thanks, extra ideas, etc.
